'''
This script allows to export missions, exploited capabilities and involved Functional Chains to Excel
It will create a folder result in the selected Capella project with the resulting xlsx file.
'''
# To run it:
#  - enable Developer capabilities if not already done (see documentation in the help menu)
#  - you can run this script by launching the contextual menu "Run As / EASE Script..." 
#    on this script. 
#    - By default, the model selected is IFE sample (aird path of the model written below)

#  - you can also run this script according to a configuration (script selected, arguments) 
#    and modify the configuration by launching the contextual menu "Run As / Run configurations..." 
#    on this script. 
#    - create a new "EASE Script" configuration
#    - define the name of the configuration: "Export_missions_exploited_capabilities_involved_FC.py" (for instance)
#    - define the Script Source path: "workspace://Python4Capella/sample_scripts/Export_missions_exploited_capabities_involved_FC.py"
