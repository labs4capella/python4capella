When you load an "EASE":https://www.eclipse.org/ease/ module and use specific methods from it, you can first declare the methods before the @loadModule@ statement:

bc.. def showInputDialog():
    pass

loadModule('/System/UI')

componentName = showInputDialog("Enter the component name:", "New Component 1")
p. This prevent the call to @showInputDialog@ to be marked as an error by "PyDev":https://www.pydev.org/.
