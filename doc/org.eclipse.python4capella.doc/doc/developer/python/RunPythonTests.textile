h1. Run Python Tests

This section describes how you can run Python tests for the simplified Capella Python metamodel.

You need to import the Python4CapellaTests and the Python4Capella projects in your runtime workspace or a Capella where Python4Capella has been installed. Both Requirement and PVMT add-ons also need to be installed. You will also need the IFE sample model from Capella.

Then you can open and run .suite files from the Python4CapellaTests project:

* **ManualTestsuite.suite** is the manual test suite
* **Testsuite.suite** is the generated test suite

You can check the "Script Unittest" view to see results. You can also export an xml report using this view (using corresponding button in the toolbar of the view). This report is needed to update the implementation status in the simplified Capella metamodel. Status are then used to generate the Word document with M2Doc.
