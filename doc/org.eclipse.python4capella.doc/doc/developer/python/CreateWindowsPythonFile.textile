h1. Create Windows Python interpreter zip file

This section describes how you can recreate the Python interpreter zip file for Windows.

The first step is to download the Python 2.7.x installer from the python web site:

"https://www.python.org/downloads/":https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have the .msi file, you will need to extract its contents using the msiexec command:

bc. msiexec /a c:\Users\user\Downloads\python-2.7.18.amd64.msi /qb TARGETDIR=c:\Users\user\Downloads\python

Note: both the .msi file path and TARGETDIR path need to be absolute.

At this point pip is not installed but it will be needed later to install packages. So we will install it using the following command inside the python folder:

bc. python -m ensurepip

Python will proceed with the installation of pip. Now we can install new packages. By default we are going to install a library to write to xlsx documents:

bc. Scripts\pip install XlsxWriter

If you prefer, you can also install XlsxWriter from the source archive. Download the source archive from the following page:

"https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/#files":https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/#files

Then use the following command:

bc. Scripts\pip install XlsxWriter-x.y.z.tar.gz

Where x.y.z is the version of the downloaded XlsxWriter archive.

Now you can import XlsxWriter in your Python scripts by adding the following import directive at the beginning of your script:

bc. import xlsxwriter

You can have a look "here":https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/ for more information on XlsxWriter.

You can find more packages to install "here":https://pypi.org/.
