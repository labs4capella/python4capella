h1. Create Windows Python interpreter zip file

This section describes how you can recreate the Python interpreter zip file for Windows.

The first step is to download the Python 3.7.9 embeddable zip file from the python web site:

"https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-embed-amd64.zip":https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-embed-amd64.zip

Once you have the zip file, you can unpack it.

At this point pip is not installed but it will be needed later to install packages. You will need to download the "get-pip.py":https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py script in the unpacked Python folder then run:

bc. python get-pip.py

Python will proceed with the download and installation of pip. One more step is needed before we can use pip. You need to edite the file python37._pth to add the created Lib\site-packages folder:

bc. python37.zip
    .
    Lib\site-packages

Now we can install new packages. By default we are going to install a library to write to xlsx documents:

bc. Scripts\pip install XlsxWriter

This will download the package and install it.

If you prefer, you can also install XlsxWriter from the source archive. Download the source archive from the following page:

"https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/#files":https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/#files

Then use the following command:

bc. Scripts\pip install XlsxWriter-x.y.z.tar.gz

Where x.y.z is the version of the downloaded XlsxWriter archive.

Now you can import XlsxWriter in your Python scripts by adding the following import directive at the beginning of your script:

bc. import xlsxwriter

You can have a look "here":https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/ for more information on XlsxWriter.

You can find more packages to install "here":https://pypi.org/.
