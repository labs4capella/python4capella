		<h1 id="InstallnewPythonpackage">Install new Python package</h1>
		<p>NOTE: there is a known issue with the use of panda/numpy packages. See this 
			<a href="https://github.com/labs4capella/python4capella/issues/112">issue</a> for more details and workaround.
		</p>
		<p>To install new Python packages on Linux or Mac OS X, please refer to your distribution documentation.</p>
		<p>If you are using Windows and the python37.zip file provided with Python for Capella, you will need to update pip using the following command from the folder where you extracted the python37.zip:</p>
		<pre><code>python -m pip install --upgrade pip
</code></pre>
		<p>You can then install a new package using the following command from the folder where you extracted the python37.zip:</p>
		<pre><code>Scripts\pip install *package name*
</code></pre>
		<p>For instance:</p>
		<pre><code>Scripts\pip install Python-Chart
</code></pre>
		<p>This will download and install the package and make it available to import in your scripts. For more details on importing the newly installed package please refer to its documentation.</p>
		<p>You can find packages 
			<a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index (PyPI)</a>.
		</p>
		<p>You can also install a package from its source archive, you will need to go to the project page on 
			<a href="https://pypi.org/">https://pypi.org/</a> and select the Download files menu on the left. For instance if you want to install Python-Chart form the source, go to the following page:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://pypi.org/project/Python-Chart/#files">https://pypi.org/project/Python-Chart/#files</a>
		</p>
		<p>Once you downloaded the archive, from the folder where you extracted the python37.zip, you can use the following command to install the package, in this example:</p>
		<pre><code>Scripts\pip install Python-Chart-1.39.tar.gz
</code></pre>
		<p>Note: the version in the archive name might be different in your case.</p>
